# Kelly Li's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This website showcases my journey as a data scientist and culinary enthusiast. I've meticulously crafted this site's design using Figma, and brought it to life with a blend of technologies to create an engaging experience:

- **CSS:** Styling is an art, and I've employed CSS to make every pixel shine.
- **HTML:** The backbone of web content, I've woven HTML to structure my ideas.
- **JavaScript:** Interactivity comes to life with JavaScript, adding those dynamic touches.

Feel free to explore my projects, learn more about my background, and get in touch. You can view the website live at [Portfolio Link](https://kelly-li.netlify.app/). It's been hosted with care on Netlify.
